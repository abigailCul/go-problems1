# Go Problem Sheet solutions
# Author: Abigail Culkin

These are my solutions for short programs using the Go programming language.
They are numbered from 1 to 10 and at the top of each in the comments iit explains what the question is.

## Go Programming Language

Open source programming language

I have started running the program in package main
The language also uses import paths e.g. fmt, math/rand, strings

package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

It also uses variables, go is different from other languages in the way the type comes after 
x int
var x int 
you can also do i := 1

The print line in go is done like 
fmt.Println("Hello World")


## Prerequisites

I used visual studio code for the programs. I also used the command line to run the programs.
To do this you need to download go and run go from the command line.
You can install go at this link:
https://golang.org/dl/

## Testing the programs

You test the programs from the command line.
Once you are in the correct folder where the program is you can do thid by changing directory in the command line using cd "folder name"
You then use "go run example.go"

## Questions

1: Write a program that prints Hello, world! in Japanese.

2: Print the current time and date to the console.

3: Print the numbers from 1-100. For multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number, and for multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers that are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.

4: Function that calculates the sum of the digits of the factorial of a number. 

5: Write a guessing game where the user must guess a randomly generated number.

6: Write a function that returns the largest and smallest elements in a list.

7: Write a function that tests whether a string is a palindrom

8: Write a function that merges two sorted lists into a new sorted list.

9: Function to calculate the square root of a number using Newtonâ€™s method.

10: Write a function to reverse a string in Go.
